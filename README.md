Multi-Omics Biomarker Discovery for Cancer: Integrating Transcriptomics and Proteomics to Build a Diagnostic Panel
Problem: single-omics biomarkers are noisy
Approach: discover markers in RNA and protein separately → integrate → build small panel
Result: integrated panel is more robust + interpretable
Clinical framing: “candidate biomarkers for molecular diagnostics (needs wet-lab validation)”
